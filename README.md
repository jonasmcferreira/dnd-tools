# DND Tools

## Introduction

DND Tools is a single-page web application designed to help Dungeons & Dragons parties organize and manage their loot. It allows users to keep track of various items, including magical and non-magical objects, their weights, values, and to easily split the loot among party members.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Item Database**: Includes a wide array of D&D 5e items, both magical and non-magical, with detailed information on their weight and price.
- **Search Functionality**: An easy-to-use search bar with auto-complete features to quickly find items.
- **Loot Management**: Add items to your party's loot list, automatically tallying up total weight and value.
- **Data Persistence**: Save your loot list between browser sessions without losing any data.
